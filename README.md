# EZRobotFYP
It is a Final Year Project which I have done during my Diploma with Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP). The purpose of the project is to give robots physical movements, smart vision tracking and speech recognition with the use of programming languages like C# and EZ-Script. Throughout the 3 months, I have gained good experience like operating with 3 types of robots namely, JD the humanoid, Six the spider robot and Roli the rover robot and gained skills of new programming software, EZ-Builder.

FYP folder - C# source code for Windows applications to control movement & functions of 3 different robots : Revolution JD, Revolution Roli & Revolution Six. Use Visual Studio to open FYP.sln & refer to main source codes : Revolution JD.cs, Revolution Roli.cs & Revolution Six.cs. Please download & install .NET Framework 4.6.1 Developer Pack before running the program.

EZ Robot Project folder - EZ-Script source code for mobile applications to control movement & functions of 3 different robots. To run the mobile app, register account with Synthiam & download the mobile app from Google Play / App Store. Add the 3 .ezb files into the account and view it via mobile app.
