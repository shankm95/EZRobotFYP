# EZRobotFYP
 It is a Final Year Project which I have done during my Diploma with Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP). The purpose of the project is to give robots physical movements, smart vision tracking and speech recognition with the use of programming languages like C# and EZ-Script. Throughout the 3 months, I have gained good experience like operating with 3 types of robots namely, JD the humanoid, Six the spider robot and Roli the rover robot and gained skills of new programming software, EZ-Builder.
